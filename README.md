# Meals App

This project is a Flutter application that I developed to create a multi-screen experience. Throughout the development process, I gained proficiency in managing screen stacks, implemented tab bars, incorporated a side drawer, and integrated a bottom navigation screen for enhanced user navigation.

## Key Features

1. Multi-Screen Experience: The app is structured with multiple screens to ensure a seamless and intuitive user journey.

2. Tab Bars: Utilized tab bars to enhance user interaction, allowing for easy navigation between different sections of the application.

3. Side Drawer: Integrated a side drawer for additional navigation options, providing users with convenient access to various app functionalities.

4. Bottom Navigation Screen: Implemented a bottom navigation screen to enhance user experience and facilitate quick navigation to essential app sections.

5. Category Filters: Applied various filters to enable users to easily differentiate between different food categories. This feature enhances the overall user experience by allowing users to explore and find their desired meals effortlessly.
